                    <p>Hi and welcome. There may not be that much to look at right now but that change. You see I am currently taking a coding bootcamp to learn and practice the skill of web development. So far we have learned HTML, CSS and some languages in Javascript. I think the next we learn is Node in Javascript which I'm looking forward to because it looks really cool. Now I may not have much expierence right in the field, but I do have expierence with people. I love working with people. Sure there are some exceptions, but for the most part I find the best part of my jobs so far have been the people. I like hearing and learning about different cultures and ideas while finding out what hobbies their into and what gets them excited to get out of bed every morning. Anyway I hope to fill this website up with more expierence in the future and will enjoy looking back at the progress I have made in this career.</p>
