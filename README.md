# Updated-Portfolio

# Instructions
Your updated portfolio should:

1. Display your contact information. If you don't want to share your personal email or phone number, use a separate email that you will only use for coding, also known as a developer email, and/or a call forwarding service, such as [Google Voice](https://voice.google.com/).

2. Have links to your GitHub profile and LinkedIn profile

3. Have a link to a downloadable PDF of your resume

4. Display at least 2 examples of student work from either deployed projects or homeworks. For each project, make sure you have the following:

	* Project title

	* Link to the deployed version

	* Link to the GitHub repository

	* Screenshot of the deployed application

5. Have a polished, mobile-responsive user interface
